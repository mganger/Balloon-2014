Balloon-2014
============

Houghton College Science Honors Balloon Project

This is the code for the weather balloon (slave) and the recieving computer on the ground (master). The slave code will be written to comply with the Arduino Due (which uses a variant of C++ for its sketchbook code), and the master will be written in C++.

As of now, the only way to compile is to use G++ (or an equivalent compiler) directly because we haven't setup the Arduino's yet.
